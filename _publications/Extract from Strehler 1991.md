[Extract](/files/Strehler 1991 p54-57.pdf) from [Strehler (1991) Where is the Self? A Neuroanatomical Theory of Consciousness](https://doi.org/10.1002/syn.890070105)

Proposes a cortical implementation of a hierarchical associative memory using temporal coding (polychronous spike trains) to represent symbols. HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory, [Hawkins & Ahmed (2016) Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, a Theory of Sequence Memory in the Neocortex](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2016.00023)) uses sparse distributed representations (SDRs) and does not model individual spikes.
