Copycat revisited: analogy-making with Hierarchical Temporal Memory and spike-train engrams

"Ideally, a cognitive model should have the property that a high-level semantic structure such as Copycat's Slipnet demonstrably arises as an implicit consequence of a low-level, distributed model, but this is beyond the achievements of current research in connectionism" (Hofstadter & Mitchell 1993, p102)
